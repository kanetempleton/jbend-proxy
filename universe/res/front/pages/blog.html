    <h3>Now: PHASE II: Image</h3>
    <br>
    <p>It turns out that launching something which hasn't been developed yet is not ideal for brand image.
        First impressions are a valuable currency which can be spent on free leverage, but can also be expensive to waste.
    </p>
    <p>
        ... essentially: <b>timing is key.</b>
        <br>
        Obviously don't be overly-perfectionist and never end up producing anything.
        But absolutely do not reveal a half-ass product just because you "have to".

<h3>11/11/22: PHASE I: Launch</h3>
<br>I have officially launched my online presence today. This is something that needed to be done six years ago, but better late than never.
It may not be pretty, but I have all of the components released to the public. It is imperative that I establish my own existence.
    <br>
    The final component of this initial stage was to launch my website. I have now done that. I don't have the brain to write creatively right now. See you all soon for Phase 2.
