    <h3>Phase II: IMAGE</h3>
    <br>
    <p>It turns out that launching something which hasn't been developed yet is not ideal for brand image.
        First impressions are a valuable currency which can be spent on free leverage, but can also be expensive to waste.
    </p>
    <p>
        ... essentially: <b>timing is key.</b>
        <br>
        This is why Phase II is Image. I can't go on utilizing my time for engineering a bunch of stuff if it's all going to look like crap.
        That would be a waste of everything I produce if I want a target audience of more than myself.
        Nobody cares enough to go out of their way to figure out what a black-text-on-white-background webpage is supposed to do.
        It's hideous and the only instinct is to close the page.

<h3>11/11/22: Phase I COMPLETE: Launch</h3>
<br>I have officially launched my online presence today. This is something that needed to be done six years ago, but better late than never.
It may not be pretty, but I have all of the components released to the public. It is imperative that I establish my own existence.
    <br>
    The final component of this initial stage was to launch my website. I have now done that. I don't have the brain to write creatively right now. See you all soon for Phase 2.
