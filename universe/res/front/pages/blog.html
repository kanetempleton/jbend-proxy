    <h3>Phase II: IMAGE</h3>
    <br>
    <p>It turns out that launching something which hasn't been developed yet is not ideal for brand image.
        First impressions are a valuable currency which can be spent on free leverage, but can also be expensive to waste.
    </p>
    <p>
        ... essentially: <b>timing is key.</b>
        <br>
        This is why Phase II is Image. I can't go on utilizing my time for engineering a bunch of stuff if it's all going to look like crap.
        That would be a waste of everything I produce if I want a target audience of more than myself.
        Nobody cares enough to go out of their way to figure out what a black-text-on-white-background webpage is supposed to do.
        It's hideous and the only instinct is to close the page.
        <br>

    <b><b>So, on 11/18 this phase will launch with a graphical overhaul of this website.</b> <br>
        A few additional "projects" will be revealed on this date as well. The details on these must remain disclosed until then.
        <br><h5>I have skills to learn bye</h5></b>
