<p>Welcome to my public website. My name is Kane and this is my personal web hub. <br>
    For now, this won't interest you unless you are trying to hire me or contact me. And if you're trying to hire me, I would suggest taking a look at my <a href="https://github.com/kanetempleton">GitHub</a> for a more complete representation of my skillset.
    (After you have reviewed my <a href="/resume">resume</a> of course).<br>
    I normally wouldn't allow such a hideous website to be posted under my identity,
    but I need to start some search engine optimization so I'm throwing this up here early on to help out the algorithm.<br>
    I will be posting blog posts here soon, but for now I need a landing page.
